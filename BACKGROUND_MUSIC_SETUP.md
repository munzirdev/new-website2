- Located at: `src/components/BackgroundMusic.tsx`
- Integrated into: `src/App.tsx`

#### To Change the Background Music
1. **Replace the audio file**:
   - Add your preferred background music file to the `public/` folder
   - Update the `audioSrc` prop in `App.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   <BackgroundMusic audioSrc="/your-music-file.mp3" />
   ```

2. **Recommended audio specifications**:
   - Format: MP3
   - Sample rate: 44.1kHz
   - Bitrate: 128-192kbps
   - Duration: 1-3 minutes (will loop)
   - File size: Under 2MB for web performance
   - Style: Soft, ambient, non-intrusive

## Troubleshooting
